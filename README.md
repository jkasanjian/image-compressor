# svd-image-compressor

This Python 3 program can compress a black and white image using singular value decomposition.
The image is converted to a matrix with each element having the black intensity value of a pixel.
The program generates a rank-k approximation of the original image based on a user-entered k value. 
The higher the k-value, the more detailed the image, and the more space it 
takes up.
